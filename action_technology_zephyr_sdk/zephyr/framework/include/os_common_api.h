 * whether interrupts were locked prior to the call. The lock-out key must be
 * passed to irq_unlock() to re-enable interrupts.
 *
 * @note
 * This routine must also serve as a memory barrier to ensure the uniprocessor
 * implementation of `k_spinlock_t` is correct.
 *
 * This routine can be called recursively, as long as the caller keeps track
 * of each lock-out key that is generated. Interrupts are re-enabled by
 * passing each of the keys to irq_unlock() in the reverse order they were
 * acquired. (That is, each call to irq_lock() must be balanced by
 * a corresponding call to irq_unlock().)
 *
 * This routine can only be invoked from supervisor mode. Some architectures
 * (for example, ARM) will fail silently if invoked from user mode instead
 * of generating an exception.
 *
 * @note
 * This routine can be called by ISRs or by threads. If it is called by a
 * thread, the interrupt lock is thread-specific; this means that interrupts
 * remain disabled only while the thread is running. If the thread performs an
 * operation that allows another thread to run (for example, giving a semaphore
 * or sleeping for N milliseconds), the interrupt lock no longer applies and
 * interrupts may be re-enabled while other processing occurs. When the thread
 * once again becomes the current thread, the kernel re-establishes its
 * interrupt lock; this ensures the thread won't be interrupted until it has
 * explicitly released the interrupt lock it established.
 *
 * @warning
 * The lock-out key should never be used to manually re-enable interrupts
 * or to inspect or manipulate the contents of the CPU's interrupt bits.
 *
 * @return An architecture-dependent lock-out key representing the
 *         "interrupt disable state" prior to the call.
